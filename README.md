- someplace very familar to eat
- someplace slightly familiar to eat
- someplace completely new to eat


Tech
- Implements the Zomato API 
- Learns the user's eating habits given data and changes its suggestions accordingly

ToDo
- FRONT END IS INCOMPLETE: the app is currently only accessible through command-line
  - an elegant and fluid front-end is currently being built
 - Does not allow users to fine-tune settings for what they presently want to or can eat
